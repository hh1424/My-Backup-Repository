                <p>Hello! I'm Hannah Hoffman, a senior at Guilford College pursuing a double major in Cyber and Network Security and 
                    Computing Technology and Information Systems. 
                    My academic journey has been fueled by a passion for the ever-evolving intersection of technology and security.</p>
                <p>Outside the world of coding and network protocols, I am an avid sports enthusiast. 
                    My college experience has been enriched by actively participating in two sports, 
                    where I've learned the importance of a well-balanced diet and efficient training techniques.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am working on a captivating final project for my Database Design class. 
                    This project is a culmination of my academic knowledge and personal interest in health and nutrition. 
                    Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

            <p>Having actively participated in college sports, I have experienced the invaluable guidance of a strength coach and 
                a nutritionist who emphasized the importance of incorporating the right macros into our diets for optimal performance. 
                This inspired me to undertake a project that addresses a common struggle many individuals face - creating healthier 
                versions of favorite foods. </p>
            <p>Fueled by a desire to share and organize these recipes, I turned to social media, where I found a community eager to 
                explore the same culinary journey. However, the sheer volume of saved recipes on my phone became cumbersome, especially 
                during the cooking process.</p> 
            <p>To streamline this experience, I envisioned and developed a website connected to a meticulously designed database. 
                This platform allows me, and others alike, to effortlessly search for recipes, follow step-by-step instructions, 
                access ingredient lists, and crucially, manage macronutrient information to align with dietary goals. 
                Through this project, I aim to provide a user-friendly solution for those seeking a healthier lifestyle 
                while enjoying their favorite meals.</p>
